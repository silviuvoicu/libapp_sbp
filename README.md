This is copy in symfony2, behat, mink, phpspec  for this https://github.com/Remchi/libapp 
which is made with ruby on rails, cucumber, rspec. 
Now, it's 100 % copied, but with couple of differences:
 - I can't spec my view files
 - some things are done by the framework,  so there's no specs or code
 - specking the controllers, doesn't have much sense, they are better suited for an functional
   test or acceptance test, add all was ok, until I have to mock the security.context

Important is the way of working/thinking which is bdd in both cases.
I learn a lot doing this project, and hope to do more projects in the same manner. 

I get also my inspiration from sylius project, and of course from the documentation of 
symfony2, behat, mink, phpspec. 


If you want to test it, just clone it.
It's just a copied version, with the same functionalities, nothing more or less than the original.
